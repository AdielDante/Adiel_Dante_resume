						<h2>About me</h2>
						<p >I'm a student Software Engineer looking to start my career in the IT field.<br>
						I am open-minded and willing to learn.<br>
						I have spent most of my employment in the Financial Sector<br>
						Client service has been a big focus as well as making a mark in the Sales Team <br>
						I was always intrigued with how things work and the apps we used daily pushed me <br>
						to want to know the "how" behind this.</p>
						<p>I am currently learning the languages Java, Python,<br>
						Using these languages I have created programs covering the<br>
						fundamental concepts in programming. I am now at the Data Science and <br>
						algorithms</p>
						<p>But, enough about that, I am a Marine Aquarium hobbyist<br>
						i do love Soccer, Rugby and Motorsport<br>
						I am looking at getting back into cycling as this early morning starts<br>
						and the beautiful views has always left me wanting to go back for more<br>
						each and everytime</p>

					<h2>Education</h2>
					<p>I have a Certificate in Banking,which I completed with Chartall Business School<br>
					this was more about getting to know the client and how to handle each situation<br>
					with the client as a top priority and also to be very accurate with taking information<br>
					and doing affordability calculations <br>
					My studies now is as a Software Engineer with an amazing place called HyperionDev<br>
					who makes it possible for people like me to have a dream and achieve it as I have no IT<br>
					experience</p>

				<div class="work">
					<h2>Work experience</h2>
					<p>My last job was a Sales Consultant doing Personal Loans,Investments and opening new accounts<br>
					as well as sourcing HomeLoans and Vehicle Finance<br>
					Prior to that I was a Teller and Enquiries Clerk<br>
					which had a daily float to take in from everyone and making sure we never exceeded our daily totals<br>
					allowed to keep on the premises<br>
					I have also worked as technical support for an online shopping site<br>
					which just let you guide clients to purchase and to report any errors they might have whilst doing so<br>
